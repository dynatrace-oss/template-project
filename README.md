# :tada: :tada: Welcome to your new Project on GitHub :tada: :tada:

Congratulations, your project on GitHub was successfully created and you can start your Open Source Adventure!

As each adventure starts with good preparations, we also have something we would like you to do upe front.

- [ ] Read this ReadMe carefully, to get an overview of the files within your project.
- [ ] Write your own ReadMe which reflects your project
- [ ] Check if the [default community files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)(CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, ..) within the organization `.github`[-project](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/.github/) match your project's needs. If not, you can always provide your own, but we kindly ask you, that you also update those from time to time.
- [ ] Check if there is a `LICENSE` file within your project. If not, please create one containing the `Apache License 2.0`.

## How can I make my project public?

At first, the project will be private, as we (OSPO) want to ensure that you followed the guidelines and that everything is in place.

As soon as you are done with your initial commits, you can inform OSPO and we will take a close look at the project, and set it to public if we do think all guidelines are followed.

There is also some automation running, which will set projects, which do not follow the guidelines, to private.

## Provided Tools

### Markdownlint

To make it easier for the project to keep the Markdown files in a good shape, we added `markdownlint-cli` to the project.

1. with a `makefile` for easier execution locally, based on docker images, so it can be used in every environment as long as `docker` and `make` are available.
1. with a workflow for pull request verification based on the `makefile`.

The following files are part of this integration:

- `makefile`: as it contains the targets for execution
- `.markdownlint.yml`: as it contains the configuration for `markdownlint-cli`
- `.github/workflows/makefile.yml`: as it contains the GitHub Action configuration
